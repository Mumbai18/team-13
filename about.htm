			<p>We all wonder what to do with the many possessions we accumulate over the years. Here's an option to consider â€“ donation! Annadhan is a voluntary organisation that lives by the motto 'what is left is not over'. Their team of volunteers picks up unused and uneaten leftovers from large parties and redistributes them to hungry citizens across the city of Mumbai. This summer, they also collected utilities like clothes, bags, bedsheets and utensils for those in need. </p>
